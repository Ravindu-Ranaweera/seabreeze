            <p class="">Watching turtles are one of most riveting things that can be done. Koggala, Habaraduwa, Weligama
                are famous places for laying eggs and conservators care for those eggs until baby turtles come out and
                ready to be released to the sea. The Southern Sri Lanka is turtles' finest place for laying eggs and
                that is why those turtle conservation projects are carried on. You can also take part in this wonderful
                venture and save many sea turtles. Not only will you be able to get up close but also to release
                adorable baby turtles back into the ocean!</p>
            <P class="">Sea turtles are extraordinary creatures that have drastically declining population due to human
                interferences. Many have taken steps to establish conservation centers around the world. </P>
            <P class="">Mirissa, Kosgoda and Tangalle are amongst the other south coast destinations where one can see
                conservation efforts to save some of the sea turtle species nesting on the island’s beaches such as the
                Green Turtle, the Olive Ridley, Hawksbill, Loggerhead, and the giant Leatherback which is the largest
                sea turtle species in the world.</P>

            <p class="">Mirissa is one of the best Blue whales watching spots in the world. The waters around Mirissa
                are particularly rich in plankton which whales feed on, which will result in sightings around November
                to April / May. Mirissa is also one of the few places where swimming with blue whales is allowed.</p>
            <p class="">Choose your tour company carefully because not all of them are animal or environmentally
                friendly. Trying to get really close to the whales can frighten them unnecessarily. A good tour company
                will keep a careful distance from the whales.
                Whale watching is a waiting game. Choosing a competent company will help to know what to look out for
                and the best spots for whale sightings.</p>

            <p class="">With endless palm-fringed coastline, Sri Lanka provides an amazing dive destination. Sri Lanka
                has an abundance of great wrecks scattered off the coast. Many of the wrecks found here are covered in
                marine life, soft corals, and large schools of fish.</p>
            <p class="">In addition to its spectacular bay, Weligama is an ideal place for diving and snorkelling.The
                coral reef here scores a remarkable length of 700 meters. The site is very shallow which accounts for
                the excellent visibility.The maximum depth of this dive is 22 meters.Beside the corals, there are many
                species of fish as well as sea anemones.</p>
            <p class>Some of the great diving sites here include Yala Rock which consists of rock formations as high as
                15 meters. For a different Scuba experience, this site is recommended as it also has caves opening to
                the corals and fishes.</p>

            <p class="">Weligama is famous for the fishing technique employed by the fishermen of the village. They cast
                their lines out while balancing themselves quite cleverly on a 20-50 meter pole in shallow waters; stilt
                fishing derives its name from this act. Even though the origins of this strange way of fishing is yet
                unknown, this may be a good opportunity to chat up a few fishermen who take pride in this unique
                technique. The fishermen here guard their fishing poles with their lives and hand them down from one
                generation to another.</p>
            <p class="">Stilt fishing is a unique Sri Lankan tradition, This requires a great deal of patience. From a
                high position, the fisherman casts his line, and waits until a fish comes along to be caught. This
                method generally targets small fish. It involves waiting for several hours in complete silence to catch
                the fish. The majority of fishermen who practice this do not own modern fishing equipment. Sunrise and
                dusk are the ideal times one could catch a sight of these stilt fishermen. Foreigners can even climb the
                ritipanna to experience this.</p>

                from Mirissa Beach. You can reach here through Bandaramulla temple and also you can access this place
                via the beach. Accessing via the beach would be difficult if the sea is rough.

                This place has become so popular that a lot of people wish to make a popular frame of the headland
                leaving the sea with coconut trees. We recommend reaching this place in the morning or before sunset. If

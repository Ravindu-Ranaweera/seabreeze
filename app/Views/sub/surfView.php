                    paddling out to the unbroken waves.</li>

                    and barrels or push towards the nose – cheater five’s, hang fives and hang tens.</li>

            <p class="">During our surf lessons, we’ll be 4 hours at the beach daily. Out of those 4 hours, 2 hours are
                intensive surf lessons with a lot of individual feedback. To prevent being out of energy right after the
                morning session, we’ll take a short lunch break at the beach. After that, you’ll have the chance to
                apply everything you’ve learnt during the day on your own, but always under surveillance of our team of
                course. Here’s what we offer during our surf lessons:</p>

                take place in small groups or as private surf lessons. This guarantees quick progress and safety, with
                your coach having an eye on you the whole time. We will help you to get started. You will learn how to
                get into the wave learn the take-off technique in the white water and finally the right position on your

                                    surprised about how big and neat the room was. The beds are super-comfortable and
                                    there is a little terrace just above the room which I found very nice. Linda from
